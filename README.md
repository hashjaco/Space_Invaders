Here's my own spin-off of the classic 2D Space Invaders game implemented in Python

Description:
A very simple 2D Space Invaders game. In order for the sound and music to be enabled, the game must be run on a MacOS or Linux. If running on Windows, I'm sorry to say you'll be missing out on some fun background music and hilarious sound effects, but it is fun either way. Take a close look at what your ship fires at the enemies...

Player Controls:
Left - left
Right - right
Space - fire
